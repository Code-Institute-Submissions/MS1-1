# Shivananda Yoga Studio 
Milestone One project: User-Centric Frontend Development – Code Institute

This is a website for an imaginary Yoga Studio. The website includes information regarding the studio, membership signup area with exclusive online discount offers and exclusive features available to its members. Subsequently, it highlights information on the type of yoga classes and their schedule. Likewise, it also provides a brief overview of the yoga teachers involved with the studio and information on its upcoming events i.e., international Retreat. Finally, when scrolled to the bottom of the page users are presented with the contact details of the studio together with newsletter signup and social media follow icons.

## Demo
A demo of the website can be found [here](https://ktm28.github.io/MS1/).

## UX

The primary focus of the website is to interact online with its potential client and the existing client. In the consideration of the overall design, my main goal was to make all the information and the features of the website easily accessible to any online visitor. The use of colours in the website primarily the teal was carefully considered in view of expressing the theme of healing and calming vibe of the yoga studio whilst the partial use of light orange was to ensure its alignment with the authentic yogic culture. 



*	In the homepage, the users can see an image that of a studio and signup button with the studio motto. 
*	The Features are presented in an individual card with eye-catching icons and message. Also, there is a page exclusively dedicated to the type of yoga classes and its schedule keeping in mind that it would be of huge importance to both the existing and potential members. 
*	Users curious about the instructors on the scroll can also find a brief information corresponding with a thumbnail size rounded image of the yoga teachers in the studio. 
*	The event page which highlights the timeline and location with its upcoming retreat organized by the studio. 
*	The location in the event section are links to an external wiki site designed to ensure the user can gather some information regarding the location.
*	The footer of the website has options for signup to newsletter targeted for both potential and existing members. 
*	The footer also consists of address and other contact details of the studio for the users to get in touch with the studio. 
*	Finally, the social media icons are there to gather followers and to promote and share the online presence of the yoga studio.

* In the home page, potential members have immediate access to signing up for membership. The About page provides information regarding the studio and its community message. The classes section provides detailed information on the types of yoga taught in the studio and their schedules. Corresponding to that is a section that represents teachers’ information with their images. The event section has a location icon and name which links to external wiki sites and are implemented with target _blank for ease of user navigation. Both signup and subscribe button are linked to its respective modals. The modal for the signup button has a form where the user can choose the type of membership they want.
