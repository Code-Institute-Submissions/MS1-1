# Shivananda Yoga Studio 
Milestone One project: User-Centric Frontend Development – Code Institute

This is a website for an imaginary Yoga Studio. The website includes information regarding the studio, membership signup area with exclusive online discount offers and exclusive features available to its members. Subsequently, it highlights information on the type of yoga classes and their schedule. Likewise, it also provides a brief overview of the yoga teachers involved with the studio and information on its upcoming events i.e., international Retreat. Finally, when scrolled to the bottom of the page users are presented with the contact details of the studio together with newsletter signup and social media follow icons.
#Demo
A demo of the website can be found [here](https://ktm28.github.io/MS1/).

#UX
The primary focus of the website is to interact online with its potential client and the existing client. In the consideration of the overall design, my main goal was to make all the information and the features of the website easily accessible to any online visitor. The use of colours in the website primarily the teal was carefully considered in view of expressing the theme of healing and calming vibe of the yoga studio whilst the partial use of light orange was to ensure its alignment with the authentic yogic culture. 
Likewise, the home page on the website has an attractive background image of the group of young people doing yoga. This to ensure that the young visitors on the website feel attracted to join the membership. Highlighted over it is the motto of the studio with a member’s signup button emphasising exclusive online discount to persuade potential members to Sign up for membership.
Below the homepage, the users can see features of the studio presented in a card with eye-catching icons and message. Also, I have made a page exclusively dedicated to the type of yoga classes and its schedule keeping in mind that it would be of huge importance to both the existing and potential members. Users curious about the instructors on the scroll can also find a brief information corresponding with a thumbnail size rounded image of the yoga teachers in the studio. There’s also an event page which highlights the timeline and location with its upcoming retreat organized by the studio. The location in the event section are links to an external wiki site designed to ensure the user can gather some information regarding the location. Below it, the users arrive at the footer of the website where there are options for signup to newsletter targeted for both potential and existing members. The footer also consists of address and other contact details of the studio for the users to get in touch with the studio. And, finally, the social media icons are there to gather followers and to promote and share the online presence of the yoga studio.

#Features
##Existing Features
The page is fully responsive. The navbar is fixed on top to ensure it scrolls with the page for ease of use as it’s a single-page scrolling website. The navbar also collapses at or below the medium-size screens. The menu items in the navbar are linked to its respective page. The home page has a large signup button for the ease of use which is linked to the modal signup form allowing users to choose the type of membership they want together with the prices. All the elements on the page are consistent and adaptable with the respective devices screen size. The location name in the event section also serves as a link to external wiki site corresponding to the location. The teacher image has a minimal zoom effect when in hover state. The subscribe button in the newsletter when clicked will open a modal displaying a thank you message. The address section in the footer has an icon that is linked with the respective address in the google map. Below the address is phone number and email address of the studio allowing the user to instantly contact the studio if they wish to. The media icons are linked to their respective site. All the links to an external site when clicked will open a new browser tab in consideration with the ease of navigation between the site for the user. Most of the images and icons on the page are screen-reader friendly to facilitate the ease of use for visually impaired people.

## Features left to implement
In the future, I will like to add a separate section highlighting the price for each membership and facilitate an online paying system. Perhaps, make some adjustment with the event section such add images of retreat where the interested party can signup and pay for the retreat. I would also like to add further information to the existing card in the feature section where when users click the read more button the information will expand.

#Testing
The existing and the potential member user story achieved the intended outcome of showcasing the features and benefit for joining the membership of the yoga studio. In the home page, potential members have immediate access to signing up for membership. The About page provides information regarding the studio and its community message. The classes section provides detailed information on the types of yoga taught in the studio and their schedules. Corresponding to that is a section that represents teachers’ information with their images. The event section has a location icon and name which links to external wiki sites and are implemented with target _blank for ease of user navigation. Both signup and subscribe button are linked to its respective modals. The modal for the signup button has a form where the user can choose the type of membership they want. The links in the website have been manually tested and point correctly to the site it is related with. The testing of the HTML and CSS element has been done using online validators. The website has also been tested and runs in a various different browser such as Chrome, Edge, Safari and Firefox to check its compatibility. Different screen sizes have been tested to ensure the website is also compatible with all the popular responsive sizes.
